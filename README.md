# GD-Spammer-Purge
Inspired by the Amazing [YT-Spammer-Purge](https://github.com/ThioJoe/YT-Spammer-Purge) Tool, Meant to Remove And Delete Level Comment Spam.

## Currently Under Development
I currently have made a prototype tool that will delete certain comments depending on blacklisted discord guild ids that you provide to it 
but I plan to upgrade it's capabilities in the future to remove IP Grabbers and custom regexes, just know that this tool maybe a bit slow due 
to Robtop's own rate-limiting. My reasons behind building this software is because I feel like the eldermoderators are sometimes not enough 
and the people behind this kind of stuff can and are becoming more and more agressive about this kind of stuff. This tool currently runs 
on [gd.py](https://github.com/nekitdev/gd.py) however I'm open towards moving to rust after we get a few stable builds done in python first.

## Example Comments that should be Removed by this Upcomming tool
